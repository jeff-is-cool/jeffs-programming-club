        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>CSS is a programming language used to style markup languages. It is commonly used with html to style and make websites look good. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>The way CSS works is that in your html file you insert a style tag in the head portion of your html file. You then put the tag of whatever you want to change inside. You then put these curly brackets {} next to it. Inside of the curly brackets you put the attribute you want to change. You then put a colon : then what you want to change it to then ; and you're done. You can put multiple attributes into what you want to change. You can also put multiple things you want to change.</p>
        <hr>
        <h2>Table of important attributes</h2>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
                <th>Attribute</th>
                <th>What it does</th>
                <th>Example</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>background-color</td>
                <td>changes the background color of something</td>
                <td>background-color: red;</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>color</td>
                <td>changes the text color of all the text</td>
                <td>color: #000000; </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>font-family</td>
                <td>Chooses the font family that all text will be written in. Can also add fallback font families.</td>
                <td>font-family: monospace;</td>
            </tr>
    </body>
