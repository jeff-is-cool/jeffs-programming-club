        <p> html stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This does mean that html is not actually a coding language but rather a mark up language. html is typically used for making websites. html uses a tag based system. here is an example of what I mean <123>FISH</123> this is because html is actually just a way to display text. html is also commonly used with CSS another programming language. Here is a table of the most important tags that I know of. The void option decides whether or not you need 2 tags yes means that you just use one with nothing inside of it, and no means you need two and something in between. html is commonly used with CSS to style and make html look good. </p>
