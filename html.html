        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <hr>
        <p> html stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. This does mean that html is not actually a coding language but rather a mark up language. html is typically used for making websites. html uses a tag based system. here is an example of what I mean <123>FISH<123> this is because html is actually just a way to display text. Here is a table of the most important tags that I know of. </p>
        <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
            <tr>
                <th>Type</th>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Tag</th>
                <th>Void</th>
                <th>Use</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td rowspan="2">head</td>

                <td>No</td>
                <td>setting things up like encryption and display size</td>
