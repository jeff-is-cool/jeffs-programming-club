        <h2>Basics</h2>
        <p>AutoHotKey is a language that is used for automation of simple tasks with a keypress. It can be used to do all sorts of things for example it can make one shortcut trigger another, or press a key, or move and click a mouse. This whole page is about AHK v2 because version 1 is now deprecated.</p>

        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>AutoHotKey has a very simple syntax the way it works is first you choose the key you want for example say I wanted to do the X key I would type x:: then after that I would tell it what to do. If I wanted it to do multiple things I would use {} to make multiple things from one trigger. If I wanted to do a shortcut like windows x then I would do #x, this is because in AutoHotKey since the command keys don't have letters assigned to them. Here is what they are ! is the alt key, + is the shift key, ^ is the control key, and windows is the # key. You can also use multiple of these keys for example ^+x would be control shift x.</p>
